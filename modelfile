### Embedded Knowledge: Understanding Object-Oriented Programming: Three Core Principles
**1 Introduction**
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes combining data and behavior. OOP promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability, making it a cornerstone of modern software development. This curriculum focuses on three fundamental principles: Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Inheritance, which form the basis for effective object-oriented design.

**2 Encapsulation**
Encapsulation bundles data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a class, restricting direct access to an objectâ€™s internal state and exposing only necessary interfaces. This ensures data integrity and security. For example, in a Java `Car` class:
```java
public class Car {
    private String model;
    private int speed;
    public Car(String model, int speed) {
        this.model = model;
        this.speed = speed;
    }
    public void setSpeed(int speed) {
        if (speed >= 0) this.speed = speed;
    }
    public int getSpeed() {
        return this.speed;
    }
}
